Critic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\nClarity\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe missing Y-axis does not identify what are the measured values in the graph. We are therefore unable to interpret what the line graphs stand for\r\n2.\r\nThe missing X-axis Labels does not indicate what are the category representation. We see a range of numbers but have no clear indication that it is an age category\r\n3.\r\nThe table data does not tell to us what the data represents, and how it is related to the graph\r\n4.\r\nThe title of the graph does not lead the readers to understand what is to be represented in the graph\r\n5.\r\nThe vertical reference line does not match up to the age category data points, as the age category is a range but the median age is an absolute number\r\n6.\r\nThe data indicates the month of June. Does it mean that this is the particular data in the month of June, or this is a data for the year?\r\nAesthetics\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe white fonts in the table are not easily read, and the table could have been on a clear background for easier visuals\r\n2.\r\nThe font for “Median Age in June 2009” and “Median Age in June 2019” is not consistent. One is bold and one is not\r\n3.\r\nThe grey background of the chart is not appealing on a white page, and should be on a white background for a cleaner look\r\nb. With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nImprovements\r\n1.\r\nA line graph is drawn for 2009 and 2019 Labour Force Participation Rate (%), to be able to see the trend between the years easily.It helps us have a visual representation that 2019 has a higher labour participation rate than 2009, indicating a larger workforce, but also an older workforce\r\n2.\r\nA bar graph of the change in LPFR Rate (Percentage Point), between 2019 and 2009 is drawn with a dual axis. The bar graph represents the rate of change of the labour force participation rate from 2009 to 2019. The higher the bar graph, the larger the change\r\n3.\r\nThe charts are colour coded for easier visualisation of the positive and negative changes in the labour force participation rates. This allows us to easier visualise where the negative growth are\r\nc. Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the proposed design for an improved visualisation of the Labour Force Participation Rate. It allows us to see the overall participation rate per Age category, and also the Percentage Point change per Age category. This gives us a holistic view of the situation.\r\nd. Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Original Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original dataset is presented in this table format, with many blank cells and data we are not interested in.

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
