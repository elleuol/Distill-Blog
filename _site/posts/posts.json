However, it does not tell us if the event has happened once, or a few times in the area. Therefore we are unable to gauge how intense the armed conflict location is.\r\n2.\r\nThe map shows a scatter of the event types from 2015 to 2020. However, it does not give us an option to toggle the different year events, which may give us a better visualisation of the growing conflict in certain areas.\r\n3.\r\nThe line graph axis title states “Count of Sheet1”. This does not tell us if this is the count of event occurrences or something else. It is not clear what it is trying to indicate.\r\n4.\r\nArmed Conflict Event by Type does not indicate if it is only for Myanmar, or for all countries\r\n5.\r\nWhen you hover over the map, the tooltip that appears does not give good information about the data point. It does not indicate the town, but only gives us the geolocation. Next, it gives us the event ID, which does not indicate where the ID is from, or where we can reference it to\r\nAesthetics\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe colours of the dots in the map do not show some transparency, therefore they overlap each other, blocking some data that are behind\r\n2.\r\nThe colours chosen - green and red, are not colour blind friendly. Therefore people who are slightly colour blind may not be able to distinguish between the two data points\r\n3.\r\nThe sizes of the dots are too small to be able to see clearly on the map. The colour yellow also tends to fade into the background.\r\nWhat Can Be Improved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nImprovements\r\n1.\r\nA Multiple Value List for countries has been added, so that users are able to toggle between viewing 1 country, multiple countries or all. This helps them have a greater view of the region in one glance\r\n2.\r\nA slider for Year has been added, so that people are able to visualise the changes in conflict in the region over the years\r\n3.\r\nA Occurrences/Fatalities parameter is also included, so that the user may choose to view on the map the number of occurrences of conflict, or the number of fatalities due to conflict\r\n4.\r\nColour blind friendly colour palette are chosen for the Event Type, so that people are able to clearly visualise better on the map. Some transparency to the colours are included, so that we are able to visualise the data points on the map despite overlap.\r\n5.\r\nI have included a Count of Occurrences, or Sum of Fatalities, to the size of the dots represented on the map. This will help us visualise where are the areas of higher conflict intensity, and fatality rates\r\n6.\r\nA line graph of Occurrences and Fatalities are added to see changes in armed conflict over the years of different event types\r\n7.\r\nA Pie chart is added to be able to visualise the proportion of event types or fatalities occurring in a country\r\n8.\r\nBar charts are added to indicate the parties involved in the number of occurrences count, and also fatality count. This help us pinpoint who is accountable\r\nProposed Tableau Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interactive experience can be found at this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/louelle.teo#!/vizhome/DatavizMakeover3/Dashboard1?publish=yes\r\nStep by Step Guide to Prepare the Tableau Visualisation\r\nPreparing the Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Excel Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload the data from The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), focusing on South East Asia data set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Add to Tableau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen the data set using Tableau 2020.4. Tablleau will give a summary of all columns of data available and identify each type of data set and it’s properties.\r\nMap Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Update the column Properties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate the correct properties for each column.  1. Year properties should be updated to date format.  2. Ensure Longitude and Latitude have geolocation properties.  3. Categorical data have string properties  4. Numerical data have number properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Create Parameter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a Parameter Occurrences/Fatalities to create a dropdown choice for users to toggle.  Create a measured value with the following code, so that tableau is able to pick up the correct formulas when users toggle. \r\nOccurrences will have the formula Count([Event Type]). This will give us visibility of the count of events that occurs in a region. \r\nFatalities will have the fomula SUM([Fatalities]). This will give us a sum of the number of victims in armed conflicts in a region. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Building the Map\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Longitude and Latitude to the Columns and Rows as seen in Figure 1\r\nAdd Country, Year and Event Type to Figure 2\r\nAdd Event Type to Colours, Measured Values Occurrances/Fatalities to Size, Admin 1, Year, Country, Occurrances/Fatalities, Event Type, Event Id Cnty, and Fatalities to Labels as seen in Figure 3.\r\nChoose to show filter for Year, and Country, and choose the Single Value Slider for Year, and Multiple Values (list) for Country as shown in Figure 4\r\nName this Sheet as “Map”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Map Tooltips\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we will create this histogram graph for a tooltip in maps. It will indicate the Number of Occurrences and Fatalities of a region, based on Event Type.\r\nAdd Event Type into Columns\r\nAdd Measured Values into Rows\r\nChoose count(Event Type) and Sum(Fatalities) as the Measured Values\r\nAdd Country, Event Type and Year* to Filter**\r\nRename Aliases of Measure Names to Occurrances and Fatalities.\r\nName this Sheet “Event”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Map Tooltips\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, go back to the Map Sheet. Edit the Tooltip with the following code. this is so when the user hovers over a point in the map, the Event Tooltip will appear with the following details.\r\nLine Graph - Occurrances and Fatalities over the Years Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Line Graph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Year to Columns\r\nAdd Event Type to Rows\r\nChange the Measure of Event Type in Rows to Count\r\nAdd Fatalities to *Rows**\r\nChange the Measure of Fatalities in Rows to Sum\r\nRight Click Fatalities and choose Dual Axis\r\nRight click on the Second Axis on the Chart, and click Synchronize Axis\r\nAdd Event Type Category again to Rows\r\nAdd Country and Event Type to Filter\r\nAdd Measure Names to Colours and update the colours accordingly\r\nName the Sheet “Fatalities over the years”\r\nBar Graph - Involved Parties Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Bar Graph - Number of Occurrences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Event Type to Columns\r\nUpdate the Measure of Event Type to Count\r\nAdd Actor 1 to Rows\r\nAdd Actor 1, Country, Year and Event Type to Filters\r\nRename Sheet to “Inv Parties Occurrences”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Bar Graph - Fatality Rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Event Type to Columns\r\nUpdate the Measure of Event Type to Sum\r\nAdd Actor 1 to Rows\r\nAdd Actor 1, Country, Year and Event Type to Filters\r\nRename Sheet to “Inv Parties Fatalities”\r\nPie Chart Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Pie Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Country, Year, Event Type to Filters\r\nUnder Marks, Choose Pie\r\nAdd Event Type to Colours\r\nAdd Occurrences/Fatalities to Angle\r\nAdd Year, Country to Tooltip\r\nAdd Occurrences/Fatalities, and Event Type to Label\r\nRename Sheet as “Pie Chart”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Pie Chart - Tooltip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Sub Event to Columns\r\nAdd Occurrances/Fatalities to Rows\r\nAdd Year, Country and Event Type to Filters\r\nRename Sheet as “Sub Event”\r\nReturn to Sheet “Pie Chart” and add Tooltips according to the formula in the Figure\r\nCompiling the Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Compiling the Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompile the different sheets into the dashboard as above\r\nEnsure that the Country Filter are linked to all the sheets, through “Apply to Worksheets”\r\nEnsure that the Year is linked too all sheets except “Fatalities over the Years”\r\nEnsure that Parameter Occurrences/Fatalities is linekd to all sheets.\r\nThe Visualisation is finally done, and final product can be viewed through Tableau Public https://public.tableau.com/profile/louelle.teo#!/vizhome/DatavizMakeover3/Dashboard1?publish=yes\r\nFive Major Observations from the Visualisation\r\nNo.\r\nObservations\r\n1.\r\nSince 2010, the number of protest occurrences have risen over time across ASEAN. This is especially true for Indonesia and Thailand. However, the number of fatalities have generally remained low relative to the rise in protests.\r\n2.\r\nAcross ASEAN, the number of occurrences and fatalities from violence against civilians are concentrated in three key clusters. First, in Myanmar, and especially in the Rakhine and Shan regions. Second, in the Philippines, and involving the Police Forces of the Philippines and Anti-Drug Vigilantes. Lastly, in the Southern Thai provinces of Yala, Narathiwat, and Pattani, involving the Malay Muslim Separatists in Thailand.\r\n3.\r\nThe number of battles have also risen over time. These battles generally occur in the same regions where we see violence against civilians, namely the Northern Myanmar provinces of Shan and Kachin, Mindanao in Southern Philippines, Southern Thailand provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani, and also Papua in Indonesia.\r\n4.\r\nMyanmar is the only country in ASEAN where the fatality rate (fatalities / number of occurrences) has risen over time. This is excluding Laos where the sample size of occurrences is quite limited.\r\n5.\r\nIn Indonesia, the fatalities are disproportionately concentrated in Papua and to a smaller extent, East Java. Meanwhile, the bulk of the protests occur in the metropolitan areas such as Jakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nPresently, this is the graph presented by a Research Scientist to understand the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Which country is more pro vaccine?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph Critiques\r\nClarity\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe legend of Vac 1 does not advise what “Vac 1” stands for, and also does not advise what “2”, “3”, “4” stands for. This will mislead viewers from understanding what the bar graphs stand for and how to inteprete the data\r\n2.\r\nThe title of the graph on the left does not relate to the questions of the count. What is the population Strongly Agreeing/Strongly Disagreeing to? Are they agreeing to be Pro Vaccine? Or is the population strongly agreeing to take the Covid19 Vaccine once available to them? The title could be clearer in identifying the focus.\r\n3.\r\nThe right graph is a repeat of the left graph, but sorted by Strongly Agree Percentages. It does not provide new information from the left, except for an easy visualisation of the sorted countries.It should show the confidence interval of strongly agreed, or the different demographics of the population.\r\n4.\r\nThe x-axis of the graph on the right ends before the barchart ends. We are unable to identify what percentage of United Kingdom is. The x-axis should end where the data ends for clear representation of the datapoints.\r\nAesthetics\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe colour of the graph on the left is hard to distinguish clearly, on which is “disagreed” vs “agreed”. It does not give a good visual cue on the separations between the agreed and disagreed crowd. Therefore it does not help viewers easily identify the polarities in each country\r\n2.\r\nThe left graph axis has no decimal point, while the right graph has a decimal point on the x axis. It is not consistent. We should keep both axis consistent as they are representing the same data\r\n3.\r\nThe name of the countries are all small caps. It should start with Capital Letters for appropriate naming\r\n4.\r\nThere is a spelling error in the Title chart of the graph on the left. It should be checked and improved to prevent spelling errors for a more professional look.\r\nWhat Can Be Improved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nImprovements\r\n1.\r\nA scatterplot graph is drawn on the top left to give broad overview on where all countries stand in terms of covid confidence. It plots a score on the Y-axis on scores of the questions chosen, and a score on the x-axis, the willingness of the respondents in taking the vaccine. This scatterplot can help us have a visual exploration on the correlations between 2 questions in the survey and perhaps build some correlation inferences, such as, People are not willing to take the vaccine as they do not trust their government to give an effective vaccine.\r\n2.\r\nA dropdown question bar on the top is created so that we can view different public sentiments with regards to their willingness to take the vaccine, and their confidence and worries about it. The following questions are chosen for the drop down bar. If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it. If I do not get a COVID19 vaccine when it is available, I will regret it. If a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available to me a year from now, I definitely intend to get it. I am worried about getting COVID19. I am worried about potential side effects of a COVID19 vaccine. I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine\r\n3.\r\nA filter box on the right allows user to toggle between the different countries, and choose which countries they are interested to view. They can view individual countries, or continents, or regions by choosing the Countries of interest. Overcoming the pandemic is also a regional approach. For example, Europe will be unable to recover unless all countries in the EU have the same level of progress and success. This is due to their open border policies that allow for easy movements of people\r\n4.\r\nVarious confidence intervals are drawn to depict the sentiments based on different categories, such as Employment Status, Household size, Number of Household Children, Age Group and Gender. We are then able to focus on which group of people requires more convincing in taking the vaccine, and which are ready to take it upon distribution.\r\nProposed Tableau Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interactive experience can be found at this link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/louelle.teo#!/vizhome/Covid19_Sentiments/Dashboard2?publish=yes\r\nStep by Step Guide to Prepare the Tableau Visualisation\r\nPreparing the Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Original Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDataset is downloaded from Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub hosted at Github. It contains individual files from various countries who have conducted surveys on their population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Combine Datasets using JMP Pro 15.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we are drawing a graph to compare the different countries, we have to combine the files into 1 large dataset. We will use JMP Pro 15.2 to do this as it uses a small amount of computer memory to fulfill this task. This task can also be done with Tableau Prep Builder using the Union feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Concatenate Sheets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd the various country csv files, tick the box Create Source column, and click OK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Export Combined Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDelete off variables that are not of interest. Keep variables that represent the demographics of the responders, and also Vac_XX variables. Export the JMP Pro file back to excel format by clicking, File, Export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Export to Microsoft Excel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose Microsoft Excel and click Next.

With that, we are done with the Tableau!\r\nMajor Observations\r\n1. Young versus Old \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 38: Young versus Old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlder generation of 66 & above, inferred to be the retired population are more pro-vaccine. A higher proportion of them are more agreeable to taking the Covid19 Vaccine, and also have higher trust that their government will provide an effective vaccine. Lastly, they are less worried of the potential side effects of the vaccine.\r\nThe younger generation, however, are overall less agreeable to take the Covid19 vaccine.They have less trust in the government providing an effective vaccine, and are more worried of the potential side effect of the vaccine\r\nThe most important inference as to why the older generation feels this way, is because for the past 1 year, it is noted that the most vulnerable population to Covid19 are the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions.\r\nThe biggest casualty of the pandemic tends to be a higher proportionate of elderly population, as their immune system are not as strong and robust as the younger generation. It is also noted that the older population are also more susceptible in catching the virus, as compared to the younger generation. It is seen in the last charts, that the younger generation is not as worried in getting Covid19, as the elderly population.\r\nTherefore we see the trend globally that the elderly population are more open and agreeable to taking the Covid19 vaccine.\r\n2. Large Household with more than 3 Children versus Small Household with 0-2 Children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 39: Large Household with more than 3 Children versus Small Household with 0-2 Children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is noted that larger household with more than 3 children are more worried about the side effects of the Covid19 vaccine, and are less likely to take the vaccine.\r\nWhereas, smaller household with 0 to 2 children are less worried about the side effects of the Covid19 vaccine, and more likely to take the vaccine.\r\nThe conclusion we can gather from this data is quite surprising. As we understand that children under the age of 18 are not going to be vaccinated, they will not be protected from Covid19. However, the parents are most afraid of the potential side effects of the vaccine. The conclusion drawn is that parents may be afraid of side effects the vaccine may cause, that may hinder them from continuing to take care of their children.\r\nThe solution to this matter would probably to allow the general population to take the vaccine and offer the vaccine to parents after some time, so that they may witness the efficacy, and safety of the vaccine.\r\n3. Correlations between different countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 40: Correlations between different countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the scatterplot above, we can infer that a countries effectiveness in convincing the population to get vaccinated is strongly correlated to the trust they have in the government.\r\nIf a country trusts the government to provide an effective vaccine, they are more likely to get vaccinated. Therefore it is important that governments continue to communicate and be transparent with their nation. This will help build greater trust and confidence in the vaccines.\r\nHowever, it is also noted that there is a weak relationship between being worried of getting Covid19, and wanting to take the vaccine immediately. Therefore the fear of catching Covid19 will not fuel the confidence in people to take the vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We are therefore unable to interpret what the line graphs stand for\r\n2.\r\nThe missing X-axis Labels does not indicate what are the category representation. We see a range of numbers but have no clear indication that it is an age category\r\n3.\r\nThe table data does not tell to us what the data represents, and how it is related to the graph\r\n4.\r\nThe title of the graph does not lead the readers to understand what is to be represented in the graph\r\n5.\r\nThe vertical reference line does not match up to the age category data points, as the age category is a range but the median age is an absolute number\r\n6.\r\nThe data indicates the month of June. Does it mean that this is the particular data in the month of June, or this is a data for the year?\r\nAesthetics\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe white fonts in the table are not easily read, and the table could have been on a clear background for easier visuals\r\n2.\r\nThe font for “Median Age in June 2009” and “Median Age in June 2019” is not consistent. One is bold and one is not\r\n3.\r\nThe grey background of the chart is not appealing on a white page, and should be on a white background for a cleaner look\r\nWhat Can Be Improved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nImprovements\r\n1.\r\nA line graph is drawn for 2009 and 2019 Labour Force Participation Rate (%), to be able to see the trend between the years easily.It helps us have a visual representation that 2019 has a higher labour participation rate than 2009, indicating a larger workforce, but also an older workforce\r\n2.\r\nA bar graph of the change in LPFR Rate (Percentage Point), between 2019 and 2009 is drawn with a dual axis. The bar graph represents the change of the labour force participation rate from 2009 to 2019. The higher the bar graph, the larger the change\r\n3.\r\nThe charts are colour coded for easier visualisation of the positive and negative changes in the labour force participation rates. This allows us to easier visualise where the negative growth are\r\nProposed Tableau Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the proposed design for an improved visualisation of the Labour Force Participation Rate. It allows us to see the overall participation rate per Age category, and also the Percentage Point change per Age category. This gives us a holistic view of the situation.\r\nOn the left axis, it is represented by the Labour Force Participation Rate (%), denoted by the line graph. As you can see, the line diverges at Age Category 25-29, indicating that a higher percentage of the population has remained in active employment.\r\nOn the right axis, it is represented by the Change in LPFR (Percentage Point), denoted by the bar graphs. The bar graph shows us that at Age 20-24, there is a negative growth of youths in the labour force. This could mean that many more youths are choosing to further their education rather than enter the workforce early, or that Singapore’s birth rate has been declining.\r\nThe biggest growth in the labour force is seen at Age category 60 and above. It indicates that the population is retiring later, and many chooses to continue being in active employment well into their retirement years. It could also indicate that many feel they are unable to afford retirement due to the rising cost of living.\r\nStep by Step Guide to Prepare the Tableau Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Original Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original dataset is presented in this table format, with many blank cells and data we are not interested in. Therefore it is important to clean the dataset before we port it to tableau.\r\nDelete off the empty cells\r\nExclude data from Rows 19 onwards, and Row 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Cleaned Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cleaned data selected are the age categories, and dataset between 2009 and 2019. We are interested in these datasets as it gives us a trend in the growth of labour force participation per age category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Importing Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImport the dataset into Tableau using Connect, To a File, Microsoft Excel Choose the data file of interest and click Open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Selecting Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag the cleaned data set into the orange box\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Rename Columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename Column F1 to Age Category\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Pivot Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, highlight columns with years 2009 to 2019 and right click, Pivot. This will help create a Long Table, which will make it easier to plot a line graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Rename and Reassign Categories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename and Reassign the Date Column to Year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Add back Cleaned Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd the Cleaned Dataset Table back into Tableau through Drag and Drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Create Calculated Field- Changes in LFPR (Percentage Point)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we are trying to create a new calculated field, Change in LFPR (Percentage Point), by clicking Analysis, followed by Create Calculated Field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Formula of Calculated Field\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse formula [2019]-[2009] to obtain the change in the LFPR from 2009 to 2019. Finally, we are ready to plot the graphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag and Drop Age Category to Columns\r\nDrag and Drop LFPR (%) to Rows using a Summation\r\nDrag and Drop Changes to LFPR (Percentage Point) to the right Axis. It will be added towards the Row Column as a Dual Axis.\r\nChange the Marks of SUM(LFPR(%)) to Line graph\r\nChange the Marks of SUM(Changes in LFPR(Percentage Point) to Bar graph.\r\nIn the Marks Tab of SUM(LFPR(%)), Drag Year to Color. This will create different lines representing different years.\r\nDrag Year to the Label square to label the lines on the graph, for easier reference.\r\nAs we are only interested in 2009 and 2019, drag Year to the Filter tab, and filter out Year 2009 and 2019.\r\nNext, right click the left axis, and Move marks to front. This is so the Line graph will be above the Bar graphs.\r\nIn the Marks Tab of SUM(Changes in LFPR(Percentage Point)), Drag Changes in LFPR (Percentage Point) to Color. This will create different bar chart colour visuals to see negative and positive growth.\r\nUpdate Colors of choice by toggling the top right colour pallets to colours of choice.\r\nFinal Product\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Final Product - Tableau Visual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Observations\r\nInferences from the data\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate in Age Category 20 -24 fell 2.5% from 2009 to 2019. As we understand that Singapore’s birth rate is falling, and we are an aging population, this fall in LFPR could indicate a smaller workforce of that age group. However, we also understand that the government has provided various avenues to allow students to pursue tertiary education through increased vacancies in Polytechnics, and Universities. Therefore, the reduction in labour force at Age 20-24 may indicate that many have chosen to continue tertiary education.\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate in Age Category 30 -34 to 50-54, increased between 3.80% to 5.80%. This steady increase over the decade could be due to more foreigners choosing to work in Singapore and unfortunately, Singaporeans alone, is unable to fill all required roles in the workforce. As our economy grows, so do manpower needs.\r\nThe biggest growth in the Labour Force Participation Rate is in Age Category 60 and above. The growth is roughly 3 to 4 times higher than other age categories, indicating that more people are choosing to stay actively employed, rather than retire. There may be a few social impacts to this choice, where maybe people are insecure in retiring due to the rising cost of living in Singapore. Many may feel that they are not financially secure to stop working. Or, our population could also be healthier and stronger despite being older, and many could choose to continue working because they feel that they want to continue contributing to the economy.\r\nObservations from the visuals\r\nGraph choices: It is easier for the human eye to visualise percentage point changes through bar graphs that specifically highlight it. Line graphs do not aid the growing gaps as well.\r\nColour: It is also easier for the human eye to recognise a negative growth value if the colour is red. It helps highlight the outliers quicker and faster. Different colour line graphs also help divide the datasets easier and quicker.\r\nLabels: Labels help to guide the human eye to line representations quicker without having to check back to the legend.\r\nAnnotations: Graph annotations help paint the story quickly, without the reader needing to read the write up. It sends the message of the visuals in a point form, through a quick glance.\r\nMarrying the Two\r\nData may tell us only one point of view, therefore it is important to manipulate it to provide greater insights. Through calculating Changes in LFPR (Percentage Point), we are able to identify that there is 4 times more growth of the labour force for Age Category 60 and above.\r\nNext, using these manipulated data, we can therefore provide better visualisations for readers. It reduces the need for people to understand and inteprete the graphs on their own, but gives them the needed inferences immediately.\r\nUnderstanding the storytelling is more important than having great visuals and great data. It can easily change the perception and impressions of people if done right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
