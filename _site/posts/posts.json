    "contents": "\r\nPresently, this is the graph presented by the Ministry of Manpower on the Labour Participation Rate in 2009 and 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Resident Labour Force by Age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does This Graph Do Wrong?\r\nClarity\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe missing Y-axis does not identify what are the measured values in the graph. We are therefore unable to interpret what the line graphs stand for\r\n2.\r\nThe missing X-axis Labels does not indicate what are the category representation. We see a range of numbers but have no clear indication that it is an age category\r\n3.\r\nThe table data does not tell to us what the data represents, and how it is related to the graph\r\n4.\r\nThe title of the graph does not lead the readers to understand what is to be represented in the graph\r\n5.\r\nThe vertical reference line does not match up to the age category data points, as the age category is a range but the median age is an absolute number\r\n6.\r\nThe data indicates the month of June. Does it mean that this is the particular data in the month of June, or this is a data for the year?\r\nAesthetics\r\nCritique\r\n1.\r\nThe white fonts in the table are not easily read, and the table could have been on a clear background for easier visuals\r\n2.\r\nThe font for “Median Age in June 2009” and “Median Age in June 2019” is not consistent. One is bold and one is not\r\n3.\r\nThe grey background of the chart is not appealing on a white page, and should be on a white background for a cleaner look\r\nWhat Can Be Improved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nImprovements\r\n1.\r\nA line graph is drawn for 2009 and 2019 Labour Force Participation Rate (%), to be able to see the trend between the years easily.It helps us have a visual representation that 2019 has a higher labour participation rate than 2009, indicating a larger workforce, but also an older workforce\r\n2.\r\nA bar graph of the change in LPFR Rate (Percentage Point), between 2019 and 2009 is drawn with a dual axis. The bar graph represents the rate of change of the labour force participation rate from 2009 to 2019. The higher the bar graph, the larger the change\r\n3.\r\nThe charts are colour coded for easier visualisation of the positive and negative changes in the labour force participation rates. This allows us to easier visualise where the negative growth are\r\nProposed Tableau visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed Tableau Design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the proposed design for an improved visualisation of the Labour Force Participation Rate. It allows us to see the overall participation rate per Age category, and also the Percentage Point change per Age category. This gives us a holistic view of the situation. On the left axis, it is represented by the Labour Force Participation Rate (%), denoted by the line graph. As you can see, the line diverges at Age Category 25-29, indicating that a higher percentage of the population has remained in active employment.\r\nOn the right axis, it is represented by the Change in LPFR (Percentage Point), denoted by the bar graphs. The bar graph shows us that at Age 20-24, there is a negative growth of youths in the labour force. This could mean that many more youths are choosing to further their education rather than enter the workforce early.\r\nThe biggest growth in the labour force is seen at Age category 60 and above. It indicates that the population is retiring later, and many chooses to continue being in active employment well into their retirement years. It could also indicate that many feel they are unable to afford retirement due to the rising cost of living.\r\nStep by Step Guide to Prepare the Tableau Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Original Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original dataset is presented in this table format, with many blank cells and data we are not interested in. Therefore it is important to clean the dataset before we port it to tableau.\r\nDelete off the empty cells\r\nExclude data from Rows 19 onwards, and Row 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Cleaned Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cleaned data selected are the age categories, and dataset between 2009 and 2019. We are interested in these datasets as it gives us a trend in the growth of labour force participation per age category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Importing Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImport the dataset into Tableau using Connect, To a File, Microsoft Excel Choose the data file of interest and click Open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Selecting Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag the cleaned data set into the orange box\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Rename Columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename Column F1 to Age Category\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Pivot Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, highlight columns with years 2009 to 2019 and right click, Pivot. This will help create a Long Table, which will make it easier to plot a line graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Rename and Reassign Categories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename and Reassign the Date Column to Year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Add back Cleaned Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd the Cleaned Dataset Table back into Tableau through Drag and Drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Create Calculated Field- Changes in LFPR (Percentage Point)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we are trying to create a new calculated field, Change in LFPR (Percentage Point), by clicking Analysis, followed by Create Calculated Field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Formula of Calculated Field\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse formula [2019]-[2009] to obtain the change in the LFPR from 2009 to 2019. Finally, we are ready to plot the graphs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag and Drop Age Category to Columns\r\nDrag and Drop LFPR (%) to Rows using a Summation\r\nDrag and Drop Changes to LFPR (Percentage Point) to the right Axis. It will be added towards the Row Column as a Dual Axis.\r\nChange the Marks of SUM(LFPR(%)) to Line graph\r\nChange the Marks of SUM(Changes in LFPR(Percentage Point) to Bar graph.\r\nIn the Marks Tab of SUM(LFPR(%)), Drag Year to Color. This will create different lines representing different years.\r\nDrag Year to the Label square to label the lines on the graph, for easier reference.\r\nAs we are only interested in 2009 and 2019, drag Year to the Filter tab, and filter out Year 2009 and 2019.\r\nNext, right click the left axis, and Move marks to front. This is so the Line graph will be above the Bar graphs.\r\nIn the Marks Tab of SUM(Changes in LFPR(Percentage Point)), Drag Changes in LFPR (Percentage Point) to Color. This will create different bar chart colour visuals to see negative and positive growth.\r\nUpdate Colors of choice by toggling the top right colour pallets to colours of choice.\r\nFinal Product\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Final Product - Tableau Visual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Observations\r\nNo.\r\nObservations\r\n1.\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate in Age Category 20 -24 fell 2.5% from 2009 to 2019. As we understand that Singapore’s birth rate is falling, and we are an ageing population, this fall in LFPR could indicate a smaller workforce of that age group. However, we also understand that the government has provided various avenues to allow students to pursue tertiary education through increased vacancies in Polytechnics, and Universities. Therefore, the reduction in labour force at Age 20-24 may indicate that many have chosen to continue tertiary education.\r\n2.\r\nLabour Force Participation Rate in Age Category 30 -34 to 50-54, increased between 3.80% to 5.80%. This steady increase over the decade could be due to more foreigners choosing to work in Singapore and unfortunately, Singaporeans alone, is unable to fill all required roles in the workforce. As our economy grows, so do manpower needs.\r\n3.\r\nThe biggest growth in the Labour Force Participation Rate is in Age Category 60 and above. The growth is roughly 3 to 4 times higher than other age cateogries, indicating that more people are choosing to stay actively employed, rather than retire. There may be a few social impacts to this choice, where people are insecure in retiring due to the rising cost of living in Singapor. Many may feel that they are not financially secure to stop working. Next, our population could also be healthier and stronger despite being older, and many could choose to continue working because they feel that they want to continue contributing to the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
