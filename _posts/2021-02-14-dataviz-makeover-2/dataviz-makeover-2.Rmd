Presently, this is the graph presented by a Research Scientist to understand the willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Which country is more pro vaccine?", fig.align='center',layout="l-body-outset",dpi=200}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Original.png")

## **Graph Critiques**


|Clarity|Critique|
|-|--------|
|1. |The legend of Vac 1 does not advise what "Vac 1" stands for, and also does not advise what "2", "3", "4" stands for|
|2. |The colour of the graph on the left is hard to distinguish clearly, on which is "disagreed" vs "agreed". |
|3. |The title of the graph on the left does not relate to the questions of the count. What is the population Strongly Agreeing/Strongly Disagreeing to?|
|4. | The right graph is a repeat of the left graph, but sorted. It does not provide new information from the left, except for an easy visualisation of the sorted countries.|


|Aesthetics|Critique|
|-|--------|
|1. |The colour of the graph on the left is not appealing and clear on the message it is trying to address.|

## **What Can Be Improved?**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sketch of Proposed Design", fig.align='center',dpi=200}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sketch.png")
```


|No. |Improvements|
|-|--------|
|1. | A scatterplot graph is drawn on the top left to give broad overview on where all countries stand in terms of covid confidence. It plots a score on the Y-axis on the willingness of the country to get the Covid19 Vaccine, and a score on the x-axis, the trust they have in their government to provide an effective vaccine.|
|2. | A dropdown question bar on the top is created so that we can view different public sentiments with regards to their willingness to take the vaccine, and their confidence and worries about it.|
|3. | A filter box on the right allows user to toggle between the different countries, and choose which countries they are interested to view.|
|4. | Various barcharts are drawn to depict the sentiments based on different categories, such as Employment Status, Household size, Number of Household Children, Age Group and Gender.|
|5. | The barchart colours are changed to Red and Blue to dipict Disagree and Agree so that we are able to visualise better the polarities of the sentiments.|
|6. | Neutral responses are excluded so that we are able to view the polarities better in a country.|
